        none of the changes made in it will be applied. If the handler returns
        without error, the transaction is automatically committed.

        If any of the operations in the handler fails (e.g. a request is invalid)
        you may not find out until the *next* operation, or once the handler
        returns, due to some technicalities about how requests are handled.
